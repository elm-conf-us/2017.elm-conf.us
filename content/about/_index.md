title: "About elm-conf"
---

elm-conf exists to promote Elm and the ecosystem around it by bringing together the brightest minds in the community for a day of mixing ideas and making connections.

Thank you to everyone who helps make elm-conf US a reality!
Special thanks to [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com) for hosting the conference, to our great [sponsors](/sponsors/) for making it affordable, and of course the talk selection committee.
It wouldn't have been possible without you!

## General organizing principles:

We assume you know about Elm already.
Beginner talks, while great, are more appropriate for a general-interest conference.

A thriving community is built on diversity.
We encourage people from all different backgrounds and walks of life to attend and speak.
To ensure that all are welcome, we follow and enforce a [code of conduct](http://thestrangeloop.com/policies.html), to which all present at the conference are expected to adhere.

Community, not marketing.
We don't give the attendee list to any sponsors.

Blind auditions.
Talks are selected anonymously by a diverse talk selection committee.
