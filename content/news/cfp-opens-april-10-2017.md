The elm-conf call for proposals (CFP) period opens April 10, 2017.
This is when you can submit a talk for inclusion in the conference.
Submissions will be evaluated blindly by a small panel.
Accepted speakers will get a ticket to the conference, lodging, and travel assistance.

If it's your first time proposing a talk, don't worry!
We'll provide a round of feedback for all talks submitted before the last three days of the CFP period.

That said, here are some resources for writing good talk proposals:

And some tips from [Sarah Mei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/821924554779955200), reproduced here:

> My #1 conf talk description tip: no first-person sentences.
> "You will learn" instead of "I will teach."
> "You will see" instead of "I will show."
>
> Show reviewers that you're consciously putting yourself in the place of the audience, and asking yourself: what do they want to learn?
> When the talk description is about what the speaker will do, it's usually a shitty talk because the speaker can't detach from their own viewpoint.
> I don't want talks where the speaker wants to _show_ something; I want talks where the speaker wants to _teach_ something.
>
> The difference between show and teach is how much responsibility the speaker takes for helping the audience understand.
> "You will learn X" isn't asserting an outcome&ndash;it's helping the audience imagine what they could walk out knowing that they don't know now.
> It connects to people in a more visceral way than "I will show X," and invests them in your success as a speaker.
> Using "we" ("we will explore") similarly signals reviewers that you're thinking of the audience, and can feel more collaborative than "you."
>
> The three overarching goals of removing first person from a talk description:
>
> 1. Help you, as the speaker, frame the talk around what the audience wants to learn instead of what you want to show.
> 2. Signal folks reviewing the proposal that you're already thinking about how their audience will get what they want from your talk.
> 3. Connect with potential audience members & get them excited about what they'll learn if they go to your talk.
>
> This last one is most important for a multi-track conference, but can also help sell tickets even if the conf is a single track.
