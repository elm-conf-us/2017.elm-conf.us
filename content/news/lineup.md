We're pleased to announce the 2017 elm-conf speaker lineup.
It's a wonderful mix of veteran and new speakers across a wide variety of topics.
Our full speaker lineup and full schedule can be found on [the talks page](/talks/), or you can [add our calendar to your schedule](webcal://www.elm-conf.us/talks/index.ics) for the most up-to-date information as we get closer to September 28.

We will be recording all the talks and making them available online thanks to our kind sponsors at [Ableton]({{< ref "sponsors/ableton.md" >}}).
Thanks to [Futurice](http://futurice.com/) we will have live captioning at the venue on the day of the conference.
A huge thank you to both sponsors for helping us make elm-conf more accessible to everyone!

Registration for elm-conf opens Thursday, June 8 at 10AM Central Time.
You will [buy a ticket through Strange Loop's registration](https://thestrangeloop.com/register.html), but it is not necessary to attend Strange Loop to attend elm-conf.
If you do want to attend both events be prepared to buy tickets quickly as Strange Loop usually sells out in under an hour.

See you soon!
