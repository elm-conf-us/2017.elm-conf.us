We're pleased to announce the 2017 elm-conf speaker lineup.
It's a wonderful mix of veteran and new speakers across a wide variety of topics.
This year we'll be hearing about accessibility, mapping, JavaScript interop, fashion, gaming, and more!

Our full speaker lineup and full schedule can be found on [the talks page](/talks/), or you can [add our calendar to your schedule](webcal://www.elm-conf.us/talks/index.ics) for the most up-to-date information as we get closer to September 28.


Thank you to everyone who submitted a talk.
We had a huge selection to choose from, and our acceptance rate was about 12%!
We appreciate everyone who submitted a talk, and we hope to see you soon at elm-conf!
