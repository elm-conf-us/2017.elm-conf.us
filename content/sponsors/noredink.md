[NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com/jobs) has the largest commercial Elm codebase in the world, and has [hired Elm creator, Evan Czaplicki,](http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan) to develop the language full-time. We spend almost all of our front-end coding time writing Elm. Our software helps English teachers, and their students answer millions of questions per day on our site. About half of our 20-person engineering [team](http://noredink.com/about/team) works remotely from around the world, and the other half is in our San Francisco office. [Weâ€™re hiring](https://www.noredink.com/jobs?utm_source=elmconf&utm_campaign=elmconf2017) for front-end, back-end, and ops. No prior Elm experience necessary!
