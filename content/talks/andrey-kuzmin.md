Mogee is a side-scroller that I created with my wife Nadya in three days for the #lowrezjam 2016. Since then we've been working on this game on our free time: added a music theme and improved the visuals.

You will learn how to evolve a simple time-travelling Mario example into a full fledged game. Even though Elm makes it easy and joyful, there are a few challenges to overcome:

- growing complexity of the code;
- interactions between different game objects in the game loop;
- rendering animated objects with WebGL.

In the end you will witness yet another milestone of our game, and it's going to be remarkable!
