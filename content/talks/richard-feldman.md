Richard is the author of “Elm in Action” from Manning Publications, and the instructor for the Frontend Masters 2-Day Elm Workshop. When he’s not writing about Elm, teaching Elm, speaking about Elm, or co-hosting the San Francisco Elm meetup, he likes to take a break from his job at NoRedInk (where front-end programmers spend almost almost all their coding time writing production Elm code) by kicking back and working on some of his open-source Elm projects.

Some have said he’s “into Elm,” but he’s not sure where they got that wild idea.
