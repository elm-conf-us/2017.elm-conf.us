Learn about accessibility, the elm-html-a11y library, and delve into patterns enforcing good development habits.

Elm's core library makes writing HTML a lovely experience, but making that HTML accessible can still be hard. The WAI-ARIA spec provides many modes of communication and interaction for users--but these largely attribute-based avenues are easy to ignore. Adding type-safety, an exhaustive set of attributes and tags, and friendly function names, elm-html-a11y makes writing accessible HTML nicer.
