        <p>The elm-conf call for proposals (CFP) period opens April 10, 2017.
This is when you can submit a talk for inclusion in the conference.
Submissions will be evaluated blindly by a small panel.
Accepted speakers will get a ticket to the conference, lodging, and travel assistance.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s your first time proposing a talk, don&rsquo;t worry!
We&rsquo;ll provide a round of feedback for all talks submitted before the last week of the CFP period.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That said, here are some resources for writing good talk proposals:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2017/02/12/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal">Dave Cheney: How to Write a Successful Conference Proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And some tips from <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/821924554779955200">Sarah Mei</a>, reproduced here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My #1 conf talk description tip: no first-person sentences.
&ldquo;You will learn&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I will teach.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You will see&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I will show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Show reviewers that you&rsquo;re consciously putting yourself in the place of the audience, and asking yourself: what do they want to learn?
When the talk description is about what the speaker will do, it&rsquo;s usually a shitty talk because the speaker can&rsquo;t detach from their own viewpoint.
I don&rsquo;t want talks where the speaker wants to <em>show</em> something; I want talks where the speaker wants to <em>teach</em> something.</p>

<p>The difference between show and teach is how much responsibility the speaker takes for helping the audience understand.
&ldquo;You will learn X&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t asserting an outcome&ndash;it&rsquo;s helping the audience imagine what they could walk out knowing that they don&rsquo;t know now.
It connects to people in a more visceral way than &ldquo;I will show X,&rdquo; and invests them in your success as a speaker.
Using &ldquo;we&rdquo; (&ldquo;we will explore&rdquo;) similarly signals reviewers that you&rsquo;re thinking of the audience, and can feel more collaborative than &ldquo;you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three overarching goals of removing first person from a talk description:</p>

<ol>
<li>Help you, as the speaker, frame the talk around what the audience wants to learn instead of what you want to show.</li>
<li>Signal folks reviewing the proposal that you&rsquo;re already thinking about how their audience will get what they want from your talk.</li>
<li>Connect with potential audience members &amp; get them excited about what they&rsquo;ll learn if they go to your talk.</li>
</ol>

<p>This last one is most important for a multi-track conference, but can also help sell tickets even if the conf is a single track.</p>
