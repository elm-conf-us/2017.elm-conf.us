        <meta itemprop="description" content="We&rsquo;re pleased to announce the 2017 elm-conf speaker lineup.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful mix of veteran and new speakers across a wide variety of topics.
Our full speaker lineup and full schedule can be found on the talks page, or you can add our calendar to your schedule for the most up-to-date information as we get closer to September 28.

We will be recording all the talks and making them available online thanks to our kind sponsors at Ableton.
Thanks to Futurice we will have live captioning at the venue on the day of the conference.
A huge thank you to both sponsors for helping us make elm-conf more accessible to everyone!

Registration for elm-conf opens Thursday, June 8 at 10AM Central Time.
You will buy a ticket through Strange Loop&rsquo;s registration, but it is not necessary to attend Strange Loop to attend elm-conf.
If you do want to attend both events be prepared to buy tickets quickly as Strange Loop usually sells out in under an hour.

See you soon!
