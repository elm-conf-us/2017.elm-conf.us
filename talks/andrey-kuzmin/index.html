        <meta itemprop="description" content="Mogee is a side-scroller that I created with my wife Nadya in three days for the #lowrezjam 2016. Since then we&rsquo;ve been working on this game on our free time: added a music theme and improved the visuals.

You will learn how to evolve a simple time-travelling Mario example into a full fledged game. Even though Elm makes it easy and joyful, there are a few challenges to overcome:


growing complexity of the code;
interactions between different game objects in the game loop;
rendering animated objects with WebGL.


In the end you will witness yet another milestone of our game, and it&rsquo;s going to be remarkable!



Andrey is a frontend engineer at SoundCloud. His journey into Elm was through programming games, most notably elm-flatris and elm-street-404. The latter got him interested in WebGL and then he became a maintainer of the library. Apart from work, he enjoys live music in Berlin and is a yoga newbie.
